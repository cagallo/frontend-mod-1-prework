## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I am already a huge reader and devour new information enthusiastically, so that tip from tHE SuperLearner article definitely hit home. I see learning as a lifelong journey and I really enjoy the entire process. I really like the habit of teaching others or implementing new concept/s rapidly (like working through new code in your text editor) because I have seen that when I do those things, I retain the new information better than I would have otherwise. I also like the tip to take breaks in order to break up the learning process and to help digest the new concepts.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The data types we learned about in this section include:

  a. Strings- data type that includes letters, numbers and other characters, all wrapped in quotation marks (single or double, must be the same).
  b. Boolean- data type that evaluates whether input is true or false, helps determine which script to run.
  c. Numbers- data type including all numbers, including negative numbers and floating point numbers (decimals).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var welcomeMessage = "Hello World!";
console.log(welcomeMessage);

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

You can use \\ for single line comments and \* for double line comments or to comment out code
 *\. The purpose of commenting out code is to explain what your code does. It makes your code easier to understand
 which in turn helps you and others who read your code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a place where a script can store data to tell the computer what you want it to do. It is similar to short term
memory because once you leave a page, the browser forgets any information the page holds, so therefore, we use variables to help the computer remember this information for a later time.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Reddit; 3 variables that are probably used include:

var isOver21 = true;
var isSameNode = false;
var ownerDocument = false;

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is used in programming to join together two or more strings to create a single value or new string concatenation.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

Chase Bank; I think developers use concatenating in the greeting which is similar to my example:

var userFirstName = "Cesare";
var dayOfTheWeek = "Sunday";
var timeOfDay = "Morning";

console.log("Hello" + " " + userFirstName + " " + ", Hope you are having a good" + dayOfTheWeek + " " + timeOfDay + "!");

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I am curious to why arrays and objects are not part of this section. I am guessing it is because they deal with more complex object oriented programming and require a bit more attention to detail than these more simple data types.
