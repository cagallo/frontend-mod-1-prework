## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I definitely feel like I am not a good question asker and it is something I need to work on. I tend to wait too long to ask questions and prefer to tackle things alone. It would be smart to ask more questions because I could really reduce the time
in which it takes me to sometimes troubleshoot through a situation. I also need to become more comfortable with being able to ask
the dumb questions without thinking that I will look an idiot. Thankfully, I am fairly good with google so I rarely run into a question in which I can't find an answer to.

2. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I think that removing some of the supports that we've had so far has been a helpful tool in getting us to really think like
developers. We need to be able to take initiative and be able to navigate our computers and web sources without our hands being figuratively held.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a statement that is based on the concept of if/then/else. If a condition is met, then your code executes one or more statements, else your code does something else or just skips the step. A daily life conditional is: "if it is sunny outside, I will wear sunscreen". A conditional that is probably used in a web application I use: Please enter your age, if over 18, execute this code. else (age<18), execute this other code.

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

The first if statement with condition1 will run if it evaluates to true.  After, you can add the first 'else if' statement for condition2 and if condition1 evaluates to false and condition2 evaluates to true, this code runs. The second 'else if' statement with condition3 will run its code if both condition1 and condition2 evaluate to false and condition3 evaluates to true. The final statement 'else' will run if conditions (1-3) evaluate to false.

5. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

We can use the logical AND(&&) operator if we want to check that TWO conditions have been met. If we want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, we can use the logical OR(||) operator.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Do variables need to be declared inside the function for a for loop? I've seen examples where they are so I'm wondering if there is a preference?
